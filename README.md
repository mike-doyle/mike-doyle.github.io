<h1>Welcome to my Personal Website</h1>

<p>This is the repo for my personal website that I will update as I continue my path toward my CS degree.<br>
  It will mainly be a place for me to post projects and update any relevant experience for recruiters or business partners.<br>
  </p>

  Make sure to check out the full website by <a href="https://mike-doyle.github.io/">clicking here</a>, after you have a chance to review the code. Or just go there now if you'de like!
